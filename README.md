# RENEWAL_ITEM_COUNT

With this update, item counts in the game are now displayed in a shorter and more readable format. This change allows players to quickly assess data without being overwhelmed by large numbers.

For example:

20,000 items will be displayed as 20k.

150,000 items will appear as 150k.

2,000,000 items will be shown as 2M.

This new format improves your gaming experience by making it easier to focus on important data without the hassle of large numbers.
